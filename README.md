# UniPlan

## Description
UniPlan aims to provide a unified place to organize classes, assignments, exams, and other academic activities for college students. Its purpose is to make the process of organization as easy and frictionless as possible while also helping to encourage structure and commitment in a student's schedule. 

## Installation
UniPlan is currently under development and cannot be installed from iOS and Android app stores. However, if you'd like to become a beta tester for the app, please visit our website at (https://www.uniplanteam.com) for additional information.

## Contributing
All contributions are permitted and welcome. If you'd like to make feature requests or if you're having problems with UniPlan, please send an email to yourfriends@uniplanteam.com and we'll be sure to integrate your issue into the project as soon as possible. If you'd like to contribute to the source code directly, the best way to do so is by opening a pull request into the `develop` branch. Your pull request will be evaluated by our team members first and we'll work together to properly integrate it into our codebase.
